===================
Development roadmap
===================

In its current state ``ptypes`` is highly experimental with a bunch of missing
features.

Priorites
---------
#. Python3 support
#. Make the updates to the memory mapped files
   `atomic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_%28database_systems%29>`_
#. Garbage collection for the persistent objects

Long term goals
---------------
Ptypes has the potential to evolve, on the long term, into an
efficient multi-core programing platform for CPython, working around the
problem posed by the GIL.
